A collection of weekly exercises and mini-projects completed during my JavaScript class. This repository showcases foundational concepts, hands-on practice, and progressive learning across four weeks.

Each folder contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files organized by topic and lesson.

Purpose
This repository serves as a personal archive of classwork and a reflection of my growth in JavaScript fundamentals. It’s a space to revisit concepts, experiment with improvements, and share progress with peers and mentors.
